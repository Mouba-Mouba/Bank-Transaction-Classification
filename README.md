## Predicting Categories of Bank Transaction Data
The objective of the project is to predict the category of each transaction in the bank transactions dataset. The categories are predefined, making this a multi-class classification problem. The data includes numerical, categorical, and textual features, necessitating a model that can handle diverse types of input.

### Steps to Develop the Model:
1. Load and Clean Data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
